# You Have to Burn the Rope – GameMaker Remake

This project is a faithful recreation of the classic Flash game *You Have to Burn the Rope*, originally developed by Kian Bashiri under the name "Mazapán". The original game, released in April 2008, is a satirical platformer that humorously critiques excessive hand-holding in AAA video games.

## About the Original Game

*You Have to Burn the Rope* is a brief platformer where players navigate a short level to defeat the "Grinning Colossus" by burning a rope holding a chandelier. The game concludes with the song "Now You're a Hero," composed by Henrik Nåmark.

The game was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the 2009 Independent Games Festival and received significant attention for its humorous take on game design conventions.
