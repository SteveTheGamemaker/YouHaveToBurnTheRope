## About the Original Game

*You Have to Burn the Rope* is a brief platformer where players navigate a short level to defeat the "Grinning Colossus" by burning a rope holding a chandelier. The game concludes with the song "Now You're a Hero," composed by Henrik Nåmark.

The game was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the 2009 Independent Games Festival and received significant attention for its humorous take on game design conventions.
